# R-python_LogisticRegression

MÃ´ project about Data analyst with R/python at my university. 

about 222IS2901_DAwR_P_ProcessGroup_Group3: 
My team conducts research and creates a Credit Risk Assessment Model through logistic regression, random forest and xboost algorithms.

The credit risk assessment model is based on the use of machine learning and predicts the probability of loan repayment from customers.
First of all, we will go to learn the theory about the content related to this issue such as
- Credit risk theory
- Machine learning
- Theory of algorithms and how it works (LR, RF, XGB)
- And the metrics help us understand what is a good working model.
Once we have a clear understanding of the stated goal of "Creating a credit risk assessment model", our team will easily be able to develop the application and understand what the model is doing better.

In this project, our team will support a financial bank with about 32,000 customers who want to get loans. We will use LR, RF, XGB algorithms to consider each customer's anthropological, financial,... accurate and with as little risk as possible. Because when lending to customers, financial banks need to check that they have enough money and trust to be sure to repay their loans in the future. The analysis of these factors of the customer takes a lot of time because the data file provided by the customer as well as the customer data that the bank learns itself is quite large and is always updated from time to time. real. For that reason, we need a highly efficient and accurate model to solve this problem.
